# Speech Recognition and Text-to-Speech using Python

This is a Python script that demonstrates how to use the speech_recognition and pyttsx3 libraries to perform speech recognition and text-to-speech conversion in Python.

## Prerequisites
Before running the script, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

### speech_recognition: You can install it using pip:
    pip install SpeechRecognition

### pyttsx3: You can install it using pip:
    pip install pyttsx3
    
## Usage :
Run the script and speak into the microphone. The script will convert your speech to text and play the text as speech output.

### Note: Modify the voice_id variable to select a different voice for text-to-speech conversion if desired. Uncomment the code related to printing available voices if you want to explore and choose from the available voices.
